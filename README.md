#  DIY Email Server

####  Create a new VM in a cloud provider that supports OpenBSD. I use Vultr. Here is an [affiliate link](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8529464-6G) if you want to help me out a little. ;-)
<br>

####  I named mine mail01 in the event I want to add additional servers. Simply clone this repo over to the root directory of a new install of OpenBSD 6.8, modify the follwing files prior to executing the scripts.
<br>

## I Prior To Installing

####  Upon first login run the following script, which will update the packages, patch OpenBSD, and reboot the server.
<br>

```bash
mail01# preInstallMail.sh
```

#### Log in and patch again from the CLI with the following two commands. The server should be fully up to date.

```bash
mail01# pkg_add -u
mail01# syspatch
```
#### If you haven't already login as root and clone this repo and modify the following files accordingly for your install.

```bash
#Modify the follwing files for your server
mail/smtpd.conf

#Modify the file for your desired maibox layout
mail/virtuals

#Modify this for your domain
rspamd/dkim_signing.conf

#Modify the ssl_cert and ssl_key lines for your install
dovecot/local.conf
```

#### Create your SPF Record and add to your DNS e.g.
```txt
v=spf1 mx -all
```

#### Also, ensure you have a DNS pointer record set up, so that your IP resolves to your hostname. In Vultr this is in the "Settings" section.

#### Create your DMARC Record and add to your DNS. A good resource is at:
<br>

```txt
https://dmarcguide.globalcyberalliance.org/
```

#### There are numerous methods for obtaining TLS certificates for OpenSMTPD. I use Cloudflare, which makes it easy to obtain certificates for /etc/ssl/ and /etc/ssl/private/. Which method you choose will determine how you edit the "Creating Public/Private Keys for OpenSMTPD And Setting Permissions" section of postInstallMail.sh
<br>

#### Once you have your certs configure them in /etc/mail/smtpd.conf file
<br>

## II Execute The Script

####  Run the following command
```bash
mail01# ./postInstallMail.sh
```
#### After running the script modify the mail/secrets file. These accounts are "non-user" email accounts.

```txt
mail/secrets
```

##  Verifying The Install

####  Ensure local.conf was edited for your domain name otherwise dovecot will fail to start.
<br>

#### Verify Dovecot can correctly read /etc/mail/secrets.
```bash
mail01# doveadm user user@<yourdomainname>
```
#### Verify a user can login.
```bash
mail01# doveadm auth login user@<yourdomainname>
```

####  Running the following commands should produce similar output.

```bash
mail01# ps ax | grep dovecot

62165 ??  I        0:00.03 dovecot/anvil
